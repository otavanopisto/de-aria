# de-aria

Accessibility tools HTML websites.

Pressing and releasing **Ctrl** (tap without any combo key) shows keyboard shortcut hints for all currently interactive elements. Pressing any other key, clicking, scrolling with the mouse, or any non-hover mouse event hides them. While hints are visible, **arrow keys** scroll the active scroller without hiding the hints.

---

## Usage

```html
<script type="module" src="js/index.js"></script>
```

Import the script as an ES module. No framework or build step required.

## HTML Attributes

These are the attributes you place on your own elements to control behaviour. All attribute names follow the `data-de-aria-*` convention.

### `data-de-aria-text=true`

Marks an element as text, meant to be tabbed and read only, not interacted with. This is for elements that are focusable but shouldn't be triggered by key presses, for example a custom dropdown built with a `<details>` element where the summary should be focused but not "clicked" when the user presses the key.

```html
<details>
    <summary data-de-aria-text="true">Choose an option</summary>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/option1" data-de-aria-key="1">Option 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="/option2" data-de-aria-key="2">Option 2</a></li>
    </ul>
</details>
```

### `data-de-aria-key`

**Required on every interactive element.**

The key code for keydown (with ignored case) that the user presses (while hints are visible) to trigger that element. Case-insensitive — always stored and matched in lower-case internally.

```html
<button data-de-aria-key="s">Save</button>
<a href="/help" data-de-aria-key="h">Help</a>
<input type="text" data-de-aria-key="n" placeholder="Name">
```

If omitted, the library falls back to the first character of the element's `textContent` and logs a warning.

---

### `data-de-aria-key-label`

**Optional.** Overrides the character shown on the visual badge indicator.

Useful when the displayed letter should differ from the trigger key (e.g. the key is `Escape` but you want the badge to show `Esc`).

```html
<button data-de-aria-key="s" data-de-aria-key-label="S">Save</button>
```

Defaults to the upper-cased value of `data-de-aria-key`.

---

### `data-de-aria-action`

**Optional.** Overrides the default action taken when the key is pressed.

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| *(omitted)* | Inferred from element type (see below) |
| `click` | Calls `.click()` |
| `focus` | Calls `.focus()` |
| `play` | Toggles `.play()` / `.pause()` on media elements |
| `none` | No action taken, useful for elements that should not respond to key presses for example a modal dialog with escape handled already as a keydown but also a button available |

**Default inference rules (when omitted):**

- `button`, `a`, `summary`, clickable `input` types (`checkbox`, `radio`, `submit`, `button`, `reset`, `image`) → `click`
- `input` (text types), `textarea`, `select`, `iframe`, `[contenteditable]` → `focus`
- `audio`, `video` → `play`/`pause` toggle
- Anything else → `focus`

```html
<audio controls data-de-aria-key="p" data-de-aria-action="play" src="..."></audio>
```

---

### `data-de-aria-offset-x` / `data-de-aria-offset-y`

**Optional.** Translates the badge indicator by the given amount via CSS `transform: translate(x, y)`. Accepts any valid CSS length unit (`px`, `em`, `%`, etc.).

```html
<a href="#" data-de-aria-key="h" data-de-aria-offset-x="-1em" data-de-aria-offset-y="1.5em">Help</a>
```

Both default to `0` if only one axis is specified.

---

### `data-de-aria-horizontal-alignment`

**Optional.** Controls where the badge indicator is anchored horizontally relative to the element. Honours writing direction (`start` and `end` flip in RTL).

| Value | Position |
|---|---|
| `end-inside` *(default)* | Flush against the trailing edge of the element, **inside** its bounding box (right edge in LTR, left in RTL) |
| `end-outside` | Just past the trailing edge of the element, **outside** its bounding box |
| `center` | Horizontally centered on the element |
| `start-inside` | Flush against the leading edge of the element, **inside** its bounding box (left edge in LTR, right in RTL) |
| `start-outside` | Just past the leading edge of the element, **outside** its bounding box |

```html
<button data-de-aria-key="s" data-de-aria-horizontal-alignment="start-outside">Save</button>
```

---

### `data-de-aria-vertical-alignment`

**Optional.** Controls where the badge indicator is anchored vertically relative to the element.

| Value | Position |
|---|---|
| `top-inside` *(default)* | Flush against the top edge of the element, **inside** its bounding box |
| `top-outside` | Just above the top edge of the element, **outside** its bounding box |
| `middle` | Vertically centered on the element |
| `bottom-inside` | Flush against the bottom edge of the element, **inside** its bounding box |
| `bottom-outside` | Just below the bottom edge of the element, **outside** its bounding box |

```html
<button data-de-aria-key="s" data-de-aria-vertical-alignment="bottom-outside">Save</button>
```

Combine with `data-de-aria-horizontal-alignment` and `data-de-aria-offset-x` / `data-de-aria-offset-y` for fine-grained control over badge placement.

---

### `data-de-aria-indicator-class`

**Optional.** Extra CSS class(es) added to the badge indicator `<span>` for this specific element, in addition to the base `de-aria-key-indicator` class. Useful for per-element styling overrides.

```html
<button data-de-aria-key="d" data-de-aria-indicator-class="danger-badge">Delete</button>
```

---

### `data-de-aria-scroller-class`

**Optional. Place on a `[data-de-role="scroller"]` element.** Extra CSS class(es) added to the scroller overlay box, in addition to the base `de-aria-scroller` class.

```html
<div data-de-role="scroller" data-de-aria-scroller-class="my-scroll-overlay">...</div>
```

---

### `data-de-role="scroller"`

Marks an element as the scrollable region. The library finds the first accessible element with this attribute and shows the arrow-key overlay on top of it.

The element must also be actually scrollable (i.e. have `overflow: auto` or `overflow: scroll` and content that overflows).

```html
<div data-de-role="scroller" style="overflow: auto; height: 300px;">
    <!-- scrollable content -->
</div>
```

Arrow directions are shown or hidden based on whether scrolling in that direction is currently possible. If neither axis is scrollable the overlay is not shown at all.

---

## Styling

All visual elements are plain DOM nodes with stable CSS classes. None of the base styles are injected by the library — you provide them entirely.

### Badge indicator: `.de-aria-key-indicator`

A `<span>` appended to `<body>`, positioned with `position: fixed` adjacent to the marked element's bounding box. The badge sits on the **trailing edge** of the element (right for LTR, left for RTL).

```css
.de-aria-key-indicator {
    background: #222;
    color: #ffd54a;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 0.85rem;
    padding: 2px 6px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 1px solid #ffd54a;
    font-family: ui-monospace, monospace;
    pointer-events: none;
    z-index: 9999;
}
```

Additional data attributes available for CSS hooks:

| Attribute | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `data-de-aria-direction` | `ltr` \| `rtl` | Writing direction of the source element |
| `data-de-aria-indicator-for` | key character | The trigger key this badge belongs to |

### Marked elements: `.de-aria-marked`

Added to every interactive element while hints are visible. Use this to show a highlight ring or similar.

```css
.de-aria-marked {
    outline: 2px dashed #ffd54a;
    outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Scroller overlay: `.de-aria-scroller`

A `<div>` appended to `<body>`, centered over the scrollable element. Uses CSS grid internally. `pointer-events: none` is set inline.

```css
.de-aria-scroller {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65);
    border: 2px solid #ffd54a;
    border-radius: 12px;
    z-index: 9999;
}
```

### Scroller arrows: `.de-aria-scroller-arrow`

Individual directional arrow `<div>`s inside the overlay. Each also has a directional class.

```css
.de-aria-scroller-arrow {
    color: #ffd54a;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    text-shadow: 0 1px 2px black;
}

/* Per-direction overrides */
.de-aria-scroller-arrow-up    { }
.de-aria-scroller-arrow-down  { }
.de-aria-scroller-arrow-left  { }
.de-aria-scroller-arrow-right { }
```

Arrows whose direction is not currently scrollable are hidden via `visibility: hidden` (preserving layout) or `display: none` (when the entire axis is inactive).

### Marked scroller element: `.de-aria-scroll-marked`

Added to the `[data-de-role="scroller"]` element itself while the overlay is active.

```css
.de-aria-scroll-marked {
    outline: 2px solid #ffd54a;
}
```

## Shadow DOM Support

The library allows to pierce the shadow DOM so as long as the root is exposed inside the property of `.shadowRoot` or `.root`

## Stylesheets in Shadow DOM

The library supports piercing stylesheets in shadow DOM. To do this, add the `data-de-aria-stylesheet="true"` attribute to any `<link rel="stylesheet">` element you want to be supported in shadow DOM. The library will find these, construct new `CSSStyleSheet` instances from their rules, and adopt them into shadow roots when accessibility hints are shown.

## Accessibility & Layering

The library respects the standard browser accessibility tree. An element is considered interactive only if it passes all of these checks:

- Not `disabled`
- Not `aria-hidden="true"`
- Not a negative `tabindex`
- No ancestor with `inert`, `hidden`, `display: none`, or `visibility: hidden/collapse`
- Has a layout box (not detached), unless `position: fixed`

This means that when a modal dialog is open and you set `inert` on the background, only the dialog's elements will receive hint badges — the background is automatically excluded with no extra configuration needed.

```js
// On open: make everything behind the dialog inert
document.getElementById('app').inert = true;

// On close: restore
document.getElementById('app').inert = false;
```
